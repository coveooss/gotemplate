# Literals protection

## E-Mail protection

The razor convertor is designed to detect email address such as `john.doe@company.com` or `alert@127.0.0.1`.

But it you type something like `{{ $.john.doe }}{{ $.company.com }}`, it will try to resolve variable john.doe and company.com.

The result would be `<no value><no value>` unless you have defined:

```go
{{- set $ "john" (data "doe = 123.45") }}
{{- set $ "company" (data "com = {{ $.Math.Pi }}") }}
```

In that case, the result of `{{ $.john.doe }}{{ $.company.com }}` will be `123.453.141592653589793`.

## "&#64;" protection

You can also render the "&#64;" characters by writing &#64;&#64;.

So this `@` will render &#64;.

## "&#123;&#123;" protection

You can also render "&#123;&#123;" without being interpretated by go template using the following syntax `{{ "{{" }}`.

So this `{{ "{{" }}` will render &#123;&#123;.

## Space management

With go template, the way to indicate that previous or leading spaces between expression should be removed is expressed
that way `{{- "expression" -}}`. The minus sign at the beginning and at the end mean that the spaces should be remove while
`{{- "expression" }}` means to remove only at the beginning and `{{ "expression" -}}` means to remove only at the end.

The `{{ "expression" }}` will keep the spaces before and after expression as they are.

With razor, assignation will render go template code with - on left side.

* `{{- set $ "expr" "expression" }}` => `{{- set $ "expr" "expression" }}`
* `{{- $expr := "expression" }}` => `{{- $expr := "expression" }}`

But for variables and other expressions, you have to specify the expected behavior.

| Razor expression | Go Template      | Note
| ---------------- | -----------      | ----
| `{{ $.expr }}`          | `{{ $.expr }}`   | No space eater
| `{{- $.expr }}`         | `{{- $.expr }}`  | Left space eater
| `{{ $.expr -}}`        | `{{ $.expr -}}`  | Right space eaters
| `{{- $.expr -}}`        | `{{- $.expr -}}` | Left and right space eaters

This signify that in the following sentence:

```text
    The word {{ $.expr }} will stay in the normal flow,
    but {{- $.expr }} will be struck on the previous word
```

results in:

```text
    The word expression will stay in the normal flow,
    butexpression will be struck on the previous one
```

You can also specify that the expression should be preceded by a new line:

```text
    The word {{- $.NEWLINE }}{{ $.expr }} will be on a new line
```

results in:

```text
    The word
    expression will be on a new line
```

### Indent using current indentation

This line will be rendered with 4 spaces before each word:

```go
{{- $.NEWLINE }}{{- spaceIndent (`    `) (wrap 15 "This is a long line that should be rendered with a maximum 15 characters per line") }}
```

results in :

```text
    This is a long
    line that should
    be rendered with
    a maximum 15
    characters per
    line
```

While this line will be rendered with 4 spaces and a caret before each word:

```go
list:
{{- $.NEWLINE }}{{- spaceIndent (`  - `) (list "item 1" "item 2" "item 3") }}
{{- $.NEWLINE }}{{- spaceIndent (`    - `) (list "sub 1" "sub 2" "sub 3") }}
```

results in:

```text
  - item 1
  - item 2
  - item 3
    - sub 1
    - sub 2
    - sub 3
```

While this line will be rendered with 4 spaces and `**` before each word:

```go
{{- $.NEWLINE }}{{- spaceIndent (`    ** `) (list "item 1" "item 2" "item 3") }}
```

results in:

```text
    ** item 1
    ** item 2
    ** item 3
```

It is also possible to automatically wrap list elements with the surrounding context:

```go
{{- $.NEWLINE }}{{ join "\n" (formatList "    => This is Item #[%v]!" (to 5)) }}
```

results in:

```text
    => This is Item #[1]!
    => This is Item #[2]!
    => This is Item #[3]!
    => This is Item #[4]!
    => This is Item #[5]!
```
